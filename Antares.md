> **Antares** is the brightest star in the constellation of Scorpius. 
> It has the Bayer designation α Scorpii, which is Latinised to Alpha Scorpii. 
> Often referred to as "the heart of the scorpion", 
> Antares is flanked by σ Scorpii and τ Scorpii near the center of the constellation. 
> 
> Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a slow irregular variable star 
> that ranges in brightness from an apparent visual magnitude of +0.6 down to +1.6. 
> It is on average the fifteenth-brightest star in the night sky. 
> 
> Antares is the brightest and most evolved stellar member of the Scorpius–Centaurus association, 
> the nearest OB association to the Sun. 
> It is located about 170 parsecs (550 ly) from Earth at the rim of the Upper Scorpius subgroup, 
> and is illuminating the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex in its foreground.
>
> Classified as spectral type M1.5Iab-Ib, Antares is a red supergiant, 
> a large evolved massive star and one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye. 
> 
> If placed at the center of the Solar System, it would extend out to somewhere in the asteroid belt. 
> Its mass is calculated to be 14.5 ± 1.5 times that of the Sun. 
> 
> Antares appears as a single star when viewed with the naked eye, 
> but it is actually a binary star system, with its two components called α Scorpii A and α Scorpii B. 
> The brighter of the pair is the red supergiant, while the fainter is a hot main sequence star of magnitude 5.5. 
> They have a projected separation of about 79.1 Tm (529 AU).
>
> Its traditional name Antares derives from the Ancient Greek Ἀντάρης, meaning "rival to Ares", 
> due to the similarity of its reddish hue to the appearance of the planet Mars, latinized Ares.
