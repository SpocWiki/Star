> **Barnard's Star** is a small red dwarf star in the constellation of Ophiuchus. 
> At a distance of 5.96 light-years (1.83 pc) from Earth, 
> it is the fourth-nearest-known individual star to the Sun 
> after the three components of the Alpha Centauri system, 
> and is the closest star in the northern celestial hemisphere. 
> 
> The star is named after [Edward Emerson Barnard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Emerson_Barnard "Edward Emerson Barnard"), an American [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") 
> who in 1916 measured its [proper motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion "Proper motion") as 10.3 [arcseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcsecond "Arcsecond") per year relative to the Sun, 
> the **highest known for any star**. 
> 
> Its stellar mass is about 16% of the Sun's, and it has 19% of the Sun's diameter. 
> Despite its proximity, the star has a dim apparent visual magnitude of +9.5 
> and is invisible to the unaided eye; it is much brighter in the infrared than in visible light.
>
> Barnard's Star is among the most studied red dwarfs 
> because of its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator. 
> 
> Historically, research on Barnard's Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics, 
> its astrometry, and also refining the limits of possible extrasolar planets. 
> Although Barnard's Star is ancient, it still experiences stellar flare events, 
> one being observed in 1998.
>
> Barnard's Star hosts a system of four close-orbiting, sub-Earth-mass planets; 
> Barnard's Star b was discovered in 2024 and another three were confirmed in 2025. 
> Previously, it was subject to multiple claims of much larger planets 
> that were subsequently disproven.
